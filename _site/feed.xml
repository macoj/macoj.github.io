Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

Through accompanying surveys, we gathered extensive information about the participants, including sociodemographic characteristics, Big Five personality traits, DIAMONDS situational perceptions, measure of scientific attractiveness, motivations for attending the conferences, and perceptions of the crowd (e.g., in terms of gender distribution). Linking the sensor and survey data provides a rich window into social behaviour: At the individual level, the data sets allow personality scientists to investigate individual differences in social behaviour and pinpoint which individual characteristics (e.g., social roles, personality traits, situational perceptions) drive these individual differences. At the group level, the data also allow studying the mechanisms responsible for interacting patterns within a scientific crowd during a social, networking and idea-sharing event.

Here we show that the way social groups interact in face-to-face situations can enable the emergence of degree inequality. We present a mechanism that integrates group mixing dynamics with individual preferences, which reproduces group degree inequality found in six empirical data sets of face-to-face interactions. We uncover the impact of group-size imbalance on degree inequality, revealing a critical minority group size that changes social gatherings qualitatively. If the minority group is larger than this ‘critical mass’ size, it can be a well-connected, cohesive group; if it is smaller, minority cohesion widens degree inequality. Finally, we expose the under-representation of social groups in degree rankings due to mixing dynamics and propose a way to reduce such biases.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncovering how inequality emerges from human interaction is imperative for just societies.
