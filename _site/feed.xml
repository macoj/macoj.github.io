Despite a rich literature in the field, with works improving old approaches and proposing new ones, the mechanism by which complex behavior emerges in these systems is still not well understood. This literature gap hinders the researchers’ ability to deal with known problems in swarms intelligence such as premature convergence, and the balance of coordination and diversity among agents. Recent advances in the literature, however, have proposed to study these systems via the network that emerges from the social interactions within the swarm (i.e., the interaction network). In our work, we propose a definition of the interaction network for the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. With our approach, we captured striking idiosyncrasies of the algorithm. We uncovered the different patterns of social interactions that emerge from each type of bee, revealing the importance of the bees variations throughout the iterations of the algorithm. We found that ABC exhibits a dynamic information flow through the use of different bees but lacks continuous coordination between the agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Computational swarm intelligence consists of multiple artificial simple agents exchanging information while exploring a search space.

Self-organized systems show robustness, scalability, and flexibility, which are essential properties when handling real-world problems. Swarm intelligence seeks to design nature-inspired algorithms with a high degree of self-organization. Yet, we do not know why swarm-based algorithms work well and neither we can compare the different approaches in the literature. The lack of a common framework capable of characterizing these several swarm-based algorithms, transcending their particularities, has led to a stream of publications inspired by different aspects of nature without much regard as to whether they are similar to already existing approaches. We address this gap by introducing a network-based framework−the interaction network−to examine computational swarm-based systems via the optics of social dynamics. We discuss the social dimension of several swarm classes and provide a case study of the Particle Swarm Optimization.

In this perspective, cities are evolving systems that exhibit emergent phenomena built from local decisions. While urban evolution promotes the emergence of positive social phenomena such as the formation of innovation hubs and the increase in cultural diversity, it also yields negative phenomena such as increases in criminal activity. Yet, we are still far from understanding the driving mechanisms of these phenomena. In particular, approaches to analyse urban phenomena are limited in scope by neglecting both temporal non-stationarity and spatial heterogeneity. In the case of criminal activity, we know for more than one century that crime peaks during specific times of the year, but the literature still fails to characterise the mobility of crime. Here we develop an approach to describe the spatial, temporal, and periodic variations in urban quantities. With crime data from 12 cities, we characterise how the periodicity of crime varies spatially across the city over time. We confirm one-year criminal cycles and show that this periodicity occurs unevenly across the city. These ‘waves of crime’ keep travelling across the city: while cities have a stable number of regions with a circannual period, the regions exhibit non-stationary series. Our findings support the concept of cities in a constant change, influencing urban phenomena—in agreement with the notion of cities not in equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the last decades, the notion that cities are in a state of equilibrium with a centralised organisation has given place to the viewpoint of cities in disequilibrium and organised from bottom to up.

Alterations in community structure are associated with several clinical disorders, specially schizophrenia, although its time evolution is not clear yet. In the present work, we analyze fMRI functional networks of 65 healthy subjects (HC) and 44 patients of schizophrenia (SZ), 28 of them in a chronic state (CR) of illness, and 16 at early stage (ES). We find clear differences in edges’ weights distribution, networks density, community structure consistency and robustness against edge removal. In comparison to healthy subjects, we found that networks from SZ patients exhibits wider weight distribution, larger overall connectivity, and are more consistent in the community structure across subjects. We also showed that the networks of SZ patients tend to be more robust to edge removal than healthy subjects, while having lower network density. In the case of early stages patients, we found that their networks exhibit topological features consistently in between the ones obtained from the other two groups, resulting in a tendency towards the chronic group state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Modularity plays an important role in brain networks’ architecture and influences its dynamics and the ability to integrate and segregate different modules of cerebral regions.

Evidence of nonlinear scaling of urban indicators in cities, such as wages and serious crime, has motivated the understanding of cities as complex systems—a perspective that offers insights into resources limits and sustainability, but that usually neglects details of the indicators themselves. Notably, since the nineteenth century, criminal activities have been known to occur unevenly within a city; crime concentrates in such way that most of the offenses take place in few regions of the city. Though confirmed by different studies, this concentration lacks broad analyses on its characteristics, which hinders not only the comprehension of crime dynamics but also the proposal of sounding counter-measures. Here, we developed a framework to characterize crime concentration which divides cities into regions with the same population size. We used disaggregated criminal data from 25 locations in the U.S. and the U.K., spanning from 2 to 15 years of longitudinal data. Our results confirmed that crime concentrates regardless of city and revealed that the level of concentration does not scale with city size. We found that the distribution of crime in a city can be approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent α that depends on the type of crime. In particular, our results showed that thefts tend to concentrate more than robberies, and robberies more than burglaries. Though criminal activities present regularities of concentration, we found that criminal ranks have the tendency to change continuously over time—features that support the perspective of crime as a complex system and demand analyses and evolving urban policies covering the city as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Crime is a major threat to society’s well-being but lacks a statistical characterization that could lead to uncovering some of its underlying mechanisms.

Such intriguing consumer behavior has led to its wide study across the world.

We discovered that tipping behavior is temporally stable during either the time of the day or the day of the week. Also, when people tip, there is no statistically significant correlation between the amount tipped and the people’s income. However, passengers who do not leave any tip (i.e., the stiffers) exhibit consistent patterns both temporally and spatially in which the highest frequency of stiffers occurs around 4am, and the tendency of a passenger to stiff the taxi driver presents a strong negative correlation with income.
