The data were collected at four international scientific conferences, during which we measured face-to-face contacts along with additional information about individuals.

Through accompanying surveys, we gathered extensive information about the participants, including sociodemographic characteristics, Big Five personality traits, DIAMONDS situational perceptions, measure of scientific attractiveness, motivations for attending the conferences, and perceptions of the crowd (e.g., in terms of gender distribution). Linking the sensor and survey data provides a rich window into social behaviour: At the individual level, the data sets allow personality scientists to investigate individual differences in social behaviour and pinpoint which individual characteristics (e.g., social roles, personality traits, situational perceptions) drive these individual differences. At the group level, the data also allow studying the mechanisms responsible for interacting patterns within a scientific crowd during a social, networking and idea-sharing event.

Here we show that the way social groups interact in face-to-face situations can enable the emergence of degree inequality. We present a mechanism that integrates group mixing dynamics with individual preferences, which reproduces group degree inequality found in six empirical data sets of face-to-face interactions. We uncover the impact of group-size imbalance on degree inequality, revealing a critical minority group size that changes social gatherings qualitatively. If the minority group is larger than this ‘critical mass’ size, it can be a well-connected, cohesive group; if it is smaller, minority cohesion widens degree inequality.
