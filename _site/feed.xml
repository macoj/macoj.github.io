These capabilities are a result of incorporating local-search methods into population-based metaheuristics such as swarm and evolutionary algorithms.

Studying face-to-face interaction is hence important but, at the same time, quite challenging. Surveys present a self-reporting bias, and observational studies are dependent on human encoding. In today’s digitized world, there are many opportunities for digitally “sensing” human behavior, alleviating this situation.

This chapter illustrates the social construct of face-to-face interaction and aligns it to the physical constructs of space and angle based on proxemics. Different proximity sensors are explained in detail, including an outline of their advantages and shortcomings for measuring face-to-face interactions.
