Understanding the relationship between network features and misinformation propagation is crucial for mitigating the spread of false information. Here, we investigate how network density and segregation affect the dissemination of misinformation using a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework. We find that a higher density consistently increases the proportion of misinformation believers. In segregated networks, our results reveal that minorities affect the majority: denser minority groups increase the number of believers in the majority, demonstrating how the structure of a segregated minority can influence misinformation dynamics within the majority group.
