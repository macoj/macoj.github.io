 Spatio-temporal constraints coupled with social constructs have the potential to create fluid predictability to human mobility patterns. Accordingly, predictability in human mobility is non-monotonic and varies according to this spatio-socio-temporal context. Here, we propose that the predictability in human mobility is a state and not a static trait of individuals. First, we show that time (of the week) explains people's whereabouts more than the sequences of locations they visit. Then, we show that not only does predictability depend on time but also the type of activity an individual is engaged in, thus establishing the importance of contexts in human mobility.
