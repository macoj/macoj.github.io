We propose here to use network sciences, specifically an approach based on the Barabási-Albert model, to define a dynamic communication topology for Particle Swarm Optimizers. We compared our proposal to previous approaches, including a simpler Barabási-Albert-based approach and other most used approaches, and we obtained better results in average for well known benchmark functions.
